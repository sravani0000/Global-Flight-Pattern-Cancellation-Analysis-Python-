Project Overview: Conducted an in-depth statistical analysis of 330,000+ flight records to identify the primary drivers of cancellations and delays.


Technical Stack: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.


Analytical Highlights: > * Used notched box plots to visualize the statistical significance of flight distance on seasonality. * Discovered a high correlation between short-haul flights and technical delays, providing data-backed recommendations for buffer-time optimizations.
